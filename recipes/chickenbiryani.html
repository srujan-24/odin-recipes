        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingds">
            <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken pieces cut into chunks</li>
            <li>2 large onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt, chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
            <li>3 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon chilli powder, ground black pepper, ground cardamom</li>
            <li>3 inch cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>1 pound basmati rice</li>
            <li>5 pods cardamom</li>
            <li>3 whole cloves</li>
            <li>1 pinch powdered saffron</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="stps">
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet.</li>
            <li>Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden.</li>
            <li>Add salt, cumin, chili powder, and pepper; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan. </li>
            <li>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes. </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden.</li>
            <li>Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices. </li>
            <li>Heat water and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well. </li>
            <li>Add chicken mixture; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil. </li>
            <li>Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring. </li>
        </ol>
