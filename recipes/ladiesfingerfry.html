            <li>1 tbsp lemon juice (optional, helps to remove slime)</li>
            <li>1 pinch turmeric</li>
            <li>⅓ tsp Salt as needed</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup peanuts roasted and skinned (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash ladies ﬁnger and dry them thoroughly. Wipe oﬀ with a clean cloth or absorbent papers.</li>
            <li>They should not have any traces of moisture over them otherwise they will become slimy while chopping and frying too. Chop the ladies ﬁnger to thin half inch circles.</li>
            <li>Heat a pan with oil.</li>
            <li>Add mustard, cumin, urad dal and chana dal. Fry them until the dal turns golden.</li>
            <li>Add chopped or crushed garlic, curry leaves and slit green chilies or broken red chilies. Fry till the curry leaves turn crisp.</li>
            <li>Optional - Fry onions till translucent. You can also skip them but they impart a nice aroma to the dish.</li>
            <li>Add ladies ﬁnger and sprinkle lemon juice.</li>
            <li>Fry till all of the slime goes away. Lemon juice helps to get rid of the sticky substance from the veggie. This takes about 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook till the ladies ﬁnger is slightly tender. Ensure ladies ﬁnger is no more slimy only then cover it otherwise they will become more sticky.</li>
            <li>Add coconut, red chili powder, turmeric, coriander powder or garam masala.</li>
            <li>Add the peanuts as well. You can also coarsely crush them and add. If you want the peanuts to remain very crunchy them add them while serving.</li>
            <li>Fry bendakaya vepudu till it begins to smell good for about 2 to 3 minutes. Serve ladies ﬁnger fry with rice or phulka.</li>
        </ol>
